    "1. Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was developed by Guido van Rossum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which type of Programming does Python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports various programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Python is case-sensitive when dealing with identifiers. For example, my_variable and My_Variable are considered different identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the correct extension of the Python file?\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct extension for Python files is .py.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code is both compiled and interpreted. It is first compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common blocks of code used in Python include functions, classes, loops (e.g., for and while), conditional statements (e.g., if, elif, else), and exception handling blocks (e.g., try, except, finally).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The # character is used to give single-line comments in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "\n",
    "Two functions that can help find the version of Python are sys.version and platform.python_version().\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime using the lambda construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What does pip stand for python?\n",
    "\n",
    "PIP stands for \"Pip Installs Packages\" or \"Pip Installs Python\". It is a package manager for Python that allows you to install and manage additional libraries and packages.                       \n",
    "\n",
    "11. Mention a few built-in functions in python?\n",
    "                                                                                        \n",
    "Some built-in functions in Python include print(), len(), range(), max(), min(), sum(), abs(), type(), input(), and open().\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?\n",
    "                                                                                        \n",
    "The maximum possible length of an identifier in Python is implementation-dependent but is typically 255 characters.\n",
    "                                                                                        \n",
    "13. What are the benefits of using Python?\n",
    "                                                                                        \n",
    "Benefits of using Python include its simplicity and readability, extensive standard library, cross-platform compatibility, strong community support, and wide range of applications (from web development to scientific computing).\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "                                                                                        \n",
    "Memory management in Python is handled by the Python memory manager, which allocates and deallocates memory as needed. Python uses automatic memory management through garbage collection, which helps in reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?\n",
    "                                                                                        \n",
    "To install Python on Windows, you can download the installer from the official Python website (python.org), run the installer, and follow the installation instructions. During installation, you can choose to add Python to the system PATH variable, which allows you to run Python from any command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Is indentation required in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, indentation is required in Python. Indentation is used to define the block of code such as loops, conditional statements, and function and class definitions. Python uses indentation to indicate the beginning and end of blocks of code, rather than using curly braces or keywords like end.
